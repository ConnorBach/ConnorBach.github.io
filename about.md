 My name is Connor Bach. I'm an incoming software engineer at Microsoft.

 This past summer I interned at Microsoft, writing software for their Cloud Supply Chain orgination. I've also worked as a full-stack intern at Optum, working with React and Java Spring Boot.

I studied computer science at the University of Notre Dame.
